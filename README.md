# NBStoIronNoteblocks

### Forked from JAMES0X57's lua script and updated to play NBS files with Iron Noteblocks from MiscPeripherals
#### Requires CC: Tweaked (ComputerCraft fork) and Computronics
#### Updated to and tested with FTB: Revelations 3.4.0

MiscPeripherals has not been updated since 2013, but Computronics has integrated its own Iron Noteblocks which work similarly. 
This modified script serves as an updated fork of the original, providing full compatibility with CC: Tweaked and Computronics as of 1/3/2021.

#### ComputerCraft command to add this program:
    pastebin get Pqt1knHi play
