# NBStoIronNoteblocks

## Forked from JAMES0X57's original lua script to play NBS files with Iron Noteblocks from MiscPeripherals
#### Updated to and tested with FTB: Revelations 3.4.0
#### Requires CC: Tweaked (ComputerCraft fork) and Computronics
&nbsp;  
MiscPeripherals has not been updated since 2013, but Computronics has integrated its own Iron Noteblocks which work similarly. 
This modified script serves as an updated fork of the original, providing full compatibility with CC: Tweaked and Computronics as of 1/3/2021.
